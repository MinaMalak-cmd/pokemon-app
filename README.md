# Pokemon React Application

## Overview

PokeReact is a web application that allows users to explore information about Pok√©mon. It fetches data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Tools and Technologies

- It's built using React, Typescript, Redux toolkit, RTK query
- For testing, I've used react-testing-library, and jest-fetch-mock

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (optional, but recommended for version control)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MinaMalak-cmd/pokemon-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash 
    cd PokeReact

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install
4. Run the Application : 
    ```bash 
    npm start
    ```
    
    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.\
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## To test the application
 ### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
